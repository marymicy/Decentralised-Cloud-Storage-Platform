# Decentralised-Cloud-Storage-Platform

Decentralized Cloud Storage Platform is a basic yet effective distributed storage system that eliminates reliance on centralized servers. It enables users to store and retrieve encrypted files across a decentralized network, ensuring data redundancy, privacy, and security. By leveraging peer-to-peer storage, the platform minimizes downtime and enhances accessibility. This project serves as a foundation for exploring decentralized file storage, making it ideal for learning about distributed systems, blockchain-based storage, and Web3 applications.
